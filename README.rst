jumprun
=======
    
A unix command-line tool for running scripts from any directory in
terminal, I actually developed this tool for myself as I hate to cd into
successive directories to run python scripts - jumprun allows me to do
it from any directory buy making shortcuts. Currently only python and
ruby interpreter are supported but you can add support for others like
Perl or PHP. I hope you guys find this useful :D

Platform:
~~~~~~~~~

This tool is made for unix based OSâ€™s because I hate windows :3

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

jumprun can be installed using PyPi, ``pip install jumprun``

Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool makes use of docopt - for command line parsing, termcolor -
for colorful outputs and sqlite3 - for db.

Usage:
~~~~~~

cd to the directory where the python script is present, then run
``jr add SHORTCUT-NAME python-scripts-name.py --python or --ruby``. This
makes an entry in the db - the db is created in documents under the name
``.jumprun``. Now you can simply run the script from any dir by
``jr SHORTCUT-NAME`` to execute the script. You can refresh the db by
running ``jr rm --all`` or delete one specific name by
``jr rm SHORTCUT-NAME``. You can also rename an existing shortcut by
running ``jr rename OLD-NAME NEW-NAME``. You can also get the list of all shortcuts with ``jr show`` or ``jr show --f`` to show the file name as well. Run ``jr --help`` for more :)
